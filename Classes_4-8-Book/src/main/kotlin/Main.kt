        Practice Time
        Let's talk about books for a moment, those heavy tomes of paper with printed letters.

        1 - Create a class, Book, with a title and an author.
        2 - Add a method, readPage(), that increases the value of a private variable, currentPage, by 1.
        3 - Create a subclass of Book; name it eBook.
        4 - eBook also takes in a format, which defaults to "text".
        5 - In eBooks, counting words makes more sense than pages. Override the readPage() method
            to increase the word count by 250, the average number of words per page from typewriter days.
