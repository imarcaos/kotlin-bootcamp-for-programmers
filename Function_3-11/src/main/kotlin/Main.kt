    Exercise: Functions- ex. 3-11 - Fit More Fish

    Create a function that checks if we can add another fish into a tank that already has fish in it.

    How many fish in a tank?
    The most widely known rule for stocking a tank is the one-inch-per-fish-per-gallon-of-water rule.
    However that's assuming the tank doesn't have any decorations in it.

    Typically, a tank with decorations can contain a total length of fish (in inches)
    less than or equal to 80% of the tank size (in gallons).
    A tank without decorations can contain a total length of fish up to 100% of the tank size.

    For example:
        -A 10 gallon tank with decorations can hold up to 8 inches of fish, for example 4 x 2-inch-long fish.
        -A 20 gallon tank without decorations can hold up to 20 inches of fish,
         for example 6 x 1-inch-long fish and 2 x 2-inch-long fish.

    fitMoreFish function
    Create a function that takes these arguments:

        -tankSize (in gallons)
        -currentFish (a list of Ints representing the length of each fish currently in the tank)
        -fishSize (the length of the new fish we want to add to the tank)
        -hasDecorations (true if the tank has decorations, false if not)
    You can assume that typically a tank has decorations, and that a typical fish is 2 inches long.
    That means you can set those values as default parameters.

    Output
    Make sure you test your code against the following calls, and that you get the correct output for each.
    canAddFish(10.0, listOf(3,3,3)) ---> false
    canAddFish(8.0, listOf(2,2,2), hasDecorations = false) ---> true
    canAddFish(9.0, listOf(1,1,3), 3) ---> false
    canAddFish(10.0, listOf(), 7, true) ---> true
     */

    println(canAddFish(10.0, listOf(3,3,3))) // ---> false
    println(canAddFish(8.0, listOf(2,2,2), hasDecorations = false)) //---> true
    println(canAddFish(9.0, listOf(1,1,3), 3)) // ---> false
    println(canAddFish(10.0, listOf(), 7, true)) // ---> true
}

fun canAddFish(tankSize : Double, currentFish : List<Int>, fishSize : Int = 2, hasDecorations : Boolean = true) : Boolean {
    var currentTankSpace = tankSize

    if (hasDecorations) {
        currentTankSpace = (tankSize * 80.0 / 100.0) // multiply per 80 and divide per 100 to get 80% of capacity
        currentTankSpace -= currentFish.sum()
    } else {
        currentTankSpace -= currentFish.sum()
    }
    // Next line for test only
    // println("tankSize: $tankSize, sum: ${currentFish.sum()}, availableTankSize: $currentTankSpace, hasDecorations: $hasDecorations")
    return fishSize <= currentTankSpace
}

/* another solution
    fun canAddFish(tankSize: Double, currentFish: List<Int>, fishSize: Int = 2, hasDecorations: Boolean = true): Boolean {
        return (tankSize * if (hasDecorations) 0.8 else 1.0) >= (currentFish.sum() + fishSize)
    }
