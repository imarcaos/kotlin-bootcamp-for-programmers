        Classes ex.4-3 Spice Class

        Practice Time
        Earlier, we created and filtered a list of spices.
        Spices are much better represented as objects than as simple strings.
        Because they are objects, we can perform different things with them - such as cooking.

        To recap, let's make a simple Spice class.
        It doesn't do much, but it will serve as the starting point for the next practice.

        1 - Create class, SimpleSpice.
        2 - Let the class be a property with a String for the name of the spice, and a String for the level of spiciness.
        3 - Set the name to curry and the spiciness to mild.
        4 - Using a string for spiciness is nice for users, but not useful for calculations.
            Add a heat property to your class with a getter that returns a numeric value for spiciness.
            Use a value of 5 for mild.
        5 - Create an instance of SimpleSpice and print out its name and heat.

    val simpleSpice = SimpleSpice()
    println("name: ${simpleSpice.name} , heat: ${simpleSpice.heat} ")
}
